# Aito.ai SaaS Service Description

Aito.ai is a Software-as-a-Service, where the Aito-platform is managed by us. 
You will get an API-endpoint that exposes all the functionality provided by the platform. The service is 
mainly intended as a secondary index for Machine Learning functionality. Aito.ai is not meant to be used as the main datastore 
or data warehouse. There are other tools better optimised for these purposes. 

Aito.ai operates the service, which includes managing the servers and resources needed by the service as a whole, 
as well as individual customer environments. Customer support is provided on a best-effort basis.  

The service does not include consultancy or implementation work on behalf of or for the customer.

## Subscription and termination
Aito SaaS is subscription based. Once you subscribe, you will get your own endpoint and the access keys for it 
within the next working day. We're working on our full self-service tool, but for now we want you to contact 
us on sales@aito.ai and provide us with contact details. We will contact you back. 

The Aito-subscription will start with a two week free period. During this time you can use the service 
free of charge, with limitations on the allowed API-calls. 
After the trial period the subscription is changed to a paid subscription automatically. 

The paid subscription is invoiced on a per-day basis, meaning that we will count your invoicing balance per starting 
24h of use. If you are not satisified with us the subscription can be cancelled at any time. 
The invoicing will also be discontinued at 
the start of the next full day. The day is calculated against the wall-clock time of your subscription start. 
The invoicing is sent to you on a monthly basis. 

For pre-paid subscriptions we can provide you with a discount of up to 40%. 


## What we provide 
An Aito-subscription will always contain all the functionality the platform offers. We are constantly improving the old
features as well as implementing new ones, and you are entitled to using the latest version of the software. We, however, 
won't automatically upgrade your API to avoid runtime issues in your production service. Contact us for an upgrade 
of the service. We can handle the upgrade with a downtime of a few minutes. 

The Aito platform is built around the privacy of your data. The data you store in the database is your own, and 
we don't use it or even look at it without explicit permission from you. We don't log data in the customer
messages, nor do we gather any statistics of the internals of the data. We, however, will monitor the API-usage 
(quantity of calls, response times, message sizes) in order to guarantee the quality of service for you, as well 
as to improve the service for the future.

We are interested to hear about bugs, feature requests or any other feedback. We aim to improve the service, but 
features we implement, even on request will be made available to all our customers on the same terms. 

We have a public Slack-channel where you can contact us to get support for optimal use of Aito. Ping `@Kai` 
or `@Antti Rauhala` for technical support, `@Vesku` for questions about subscription or invoicing. We promise  
to get back within the next working day, often almost immediately. 
You can also report bugs and issues on the Slack-channel, but we'd prefer an email to bugs@aito.ai for these. 
For questions about financials, you can also use the email invoicing@aito.ai. 

## What we expect from you
We will take care of running the service and the software, monitoring it and making sure things are working as 
expected. You, as our customer, are responsible for the actual data being stored in Aito. This means you need to 
have the permissions to store and use the data in Aito. In GDPR terms you are the Controller of the data, 
responsible for how, when and why you process the data. Under GDPR Aito is the Processor, i.e. we provide
the software for you, but do not use the data in any way, besides making sure it's available for your use. 

Aito must not be used for purposes, which are illegal in the EU or Finland. We reserve the right to terminate 
the subscription immediately without prior notice, and notify the police if the service is used for any illegal
purposes. 

We also expect you to make sure you use Aito in a way that does not harm or disturb other users of the service. 
Any purposeful attempts to break the software, circumvent any security measures in place, or to Aito in a 
way that can be interpreted as malice will lead to immediate termination of the subscription. We will also 
report any such incidents to the authorities. 

We also expect that you notify us immediately in case you notice that someone is acting malevolently in your 
name, eg. if your software has been cracked, or someone else is causing you harm. We will take necessary means 
to solve the problem for you.
